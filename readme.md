# About this repo
This repository contains all sorts of **unofficial** examples and extensions for iTop, both finished and unfinished.

There are some very basic examples on adding/changing/removing fields; creating new object classes. 
Advanced examples include adding menus, entirely new dashlets, flexible reports, custom front ends, ...


# Folders
- **docs**: contains info/hints on using the extensions in this repository, but also on implementing/using iTop
- **utils**: some utilities I use for debugging and development
- **web/extensions**: extensions which are actively maintained and which should be stable. You can drop and merge this under <iTop folder>/web .

- **wip**: work in progress. Unfinished. Also contains some concepts.

# What is iTop?
"iTop stands for IT Operational Portal. iTop is an Open Source web application for the day to day operations of an IT environment. At the heart of iTop is the CMDB (Configuration Management Data Base), this is originally the first part of iTop that was developed." 

It's developed by a great team at Combodo.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/Combodo/iTop) (as of end of August, 2018: development)
- [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/p/itop/discussion/) (bug reports = tickets and discussion board)


# Compatibility / branches
These are ***unofficial*** extensions (tweaks and extra features; both simple and complex) for iTop using PHP 7.2 and MySQL 5.7.

It's unknown if these extensions work on older versions of iTop or other configurations.
Making minor adjustments might be enough to make them backward compatible. (downgrading version number of datamodel XML and dependencies in module PHP file).

# History
I (Jeffrey Bostoen / jbostoen) started using iTop in 2015. Since then, I've been using and customizing this application more every day. 
I also stimulated others to use it and also made small contributions to iTop, both in code and translations.

In the meanwhile, my colleague [jdefoort](https://github.com/jdefoort) also became an iTop enthousiast and we often collaborate on new extensions.

In 2019, I got the honour of speaking at an iTop Community Event in Cologne.

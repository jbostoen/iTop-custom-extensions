Need custom development?  
Please get in touch to discuss the terms: **info@jeffreybostoen.be** / https://jeffreybostoen.be

‚ö†Ô∏è I am no longer actively updating this repository, so it does not contain all my iTop work.  
Over the years, the amount of extensions has grown a lot and they moved into their own [Github Repositories](https://github.com/jbostoen?tab=repositories&q=itop&type=&language=&sort=).  
This repo is still here as a reference though.

For my pro extensions, check out [jeffreybostoen.be](https://jeffreybostoen.be) instead. 
This includes: Auto Assigner, Maps, Multi-Factor Authentication, Portal URL brick, Suggested Articles (FAQs), Ticket Merge, Vote and Comment, ...


# About this repo


This repository contains all sorts of **unofficial** examples and extensions for iTop, both finished and unfinished.
As of 2020, this collection is being split up into subrepos. Most extensions and other work will be available here as submodules of this repo.

There are some very basic examples on adding/changing/removing fields; creating new object classes. 
Advanced examples include adding menus, entirely new dashlets, flexible reports, custom front ends, ...

# Folders
